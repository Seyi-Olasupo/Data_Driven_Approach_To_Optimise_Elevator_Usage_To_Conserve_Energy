# Data_Driven_Approach_To_Optimise_Elevator_Usage_To_Conserve_Energy

## Introduction 
In a world where constant technological advancements are driving the universe towards a greener and more sustainable future, certain particular technological inventions that utilize energy for its usage have often been overlooked, one such entity is the Elevator system.

The project uses a data-driven technique and the Crisp-DM model to provide elevator energy-saving measures to Esquare Innovations Limited, an innovation company specialised in Internet of Things (IoT), technology for sustainable solutions.

## Project Objectives
- Identify the factors that influence energy consumption and potential areas for optimisation.
- Conduct time series analysis.
- Model to predict the journey time (service time) and energy-saving opportunities.
- Translate the analysis into a minimum viable product for stakeholders.
